- [ivy](https://github.com/robpike/ivy) - Ivy is an interpreter for an APL-like language. It is a plaything and a work in progress.
- [Ivy](https://github.com/jhallen/ivy-lang) - Ivy is an extensible, dynamically typed, late binding language intended to be used as an embedded command language. It can also be used stand-alone: it can execute script files from the command line or presents a read-eval-print loop (REPL) to the user if no files are given. Ivy's extensibility is based on the fact that statements are syntactically identical to function calls. Also blocks (surrounded by braces) may be used as function arguments. Thus, new user-defined statements can be added just by defining functions. Function arguments are packaged up as thunks and may have their evaluation delayed and execution environment modified. This allows user defined functions to do many of the things that traditional language statements can do.

However, in Joy a function can consume any number of parameters from the stack and leave any number of results on the stack. The concatenation of appropriate programs denotes the composition of the functions which the programs denote. One of the datatypes of Joy is that of quoted programs, of which lists are a special case. Some functions expect quoted programs on top of the stack and execute them in many different ways, effectively by dequoting.

NScript automatically compiles the code into an assembly in memory and executes the assembly. The NScript setup application associates NScript with ".ncs" (for C# scripts), ".nvb" (for VB.NET scripts) and ".njs" (for JScript .NET scripts) file extensions. This enables any code written in these files to be executed directly by double clicking on these files in windows explorer. I wrote this tool when I needed to write a script for automating builds. A simple batch file was not sufficient for the task and I preferred to write code in C# as opposed to VBScript or JScript. This tool came in handy as I could modify the scripts easily and execute them by double clicking on the files in windows explorer.

The semantics of Piccola is defined in terms of a process calculus, an extension of Milner's pi calculus in which values communicated are forms, rather than tuples. A "form" is essentially an extensible nested record which also serves as a namespace in which expressions may be evaluated. This simple mechanism is responsible for much of the expressive power of Piccola.
- [Pico](http://pico.vub.ac.be/welcome.html) - Pico is a tiny but expressive programming language that was especially designed to teach advance computer science concepts to students in other sciences than computer science (such as Physics and Chemistry). In a sense, Pico can be seen as a non-trivial marriage between the power of languages like Scheme, and, the standard infix notation students are used to from ordinary calculus. A.o., Pico features garbage collected tables (i.e. arrays), higher order functions, objects, meta programming and reflection. But above all, Pico is small! Really small!

- [Pict](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/pict/Html/Pict.html) - Pict, a concurrent programming language based on the pi-calculus. Pict is a language in the ML tradition, formed by adding a layer of convenient syntactic sugar and a static type system to a tiny core. The current release includes a Pict-to-C compiler, reference manual, language tutorial, numerous libraries, and example programs. The core language - an asynchronous variant of Milner, Parrow, and Walker's pi-calculus - has been used as a theoretical foundation for a broad class of concurrent computations. The goal in Pict is to identify high-level idioms that arise naturally when these primitives are used to build working programs - idioms such as basic data structures, protocols for returning results, higher-order programming, selective communication, and concurrent objects. The type system integrates a number of features found in recent work on theoretical foundations for typed object-oriented languages: higher-order polymorphism, simple recursive types, subtyping, and a powerful partial type inference algorithm.

- [STOICAL](https://stoical.sourceforge.net/summary.php) - STOICAL is vastly different from its predecessors. Primarily because so much has changed since the decades ago that they were developed.  Today STOICAL is powerful and general enough to be used as a high performance replacement for semi-compiled and interpreted languages like Perl, Python, SED and Awk. And because of STOICAL's advanced support for networking and concurrent threads of execution, it can be used to write efficient long-running servers and daemons that would normally need to be written in C. The intent here is not to explore the intricacies of archaic systems, but to create a new and modern language, well suited to the world as it exists today. STOICAL might therefore be more accurately represented by the recursive acronym SINS, SINS Is Not STOIC, but this word has a remarkable stigma attached to it ;-)

The object being rewritten by a Tandem program is a collection of labelled stacks -- a finite mapping from strings to strings. The strings are always rewritten at the left edge, so they are effectively stacks. A Tandem program consists of a single rewrite rule along with zero or more pragmas. The rewrite rule is applied to an initial state to possibly obtain a final state. This rule is applied only once. However, in Tandem, a rule is a composite object which may contain subrules that get applied many times.
