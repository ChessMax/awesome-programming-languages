Some EML specifications are executable, since SML function definitions are just axioms of a certain special form. This makes EML a "wide-spectrum" language which can be used to express every stage in the development of a SML program from the initial high-level specification to the final program itself and including intermediate stages in which specification and program are intermingled.

It can also be used stand-alone: it can execute script files from the command line or presents a read-eval-print loop (REPL) to the user if no files are given. Ivy's extensibility is based on the fact that statements are syntactically identical to function calls. Also blocks (surrounded by braces) may be used as function arguments. Thus, new user-defined statements can be added just by defining functions. Function arguments are packaged up as thunks and may have their evaluation delayed and execution environment modified. This allows user defined functions to do many of the things that traditional language statements can do.

- [J](https://github.com/jsoftware/jsource) - J is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is particularly suited to the mathematical, statistical, and logical analysis of data. It is a powerful tool for developing algorithms and exploring problems that are not already well understood.
- [J*](https://github.com/bamless/jstar) - J* is a dynamic embeddable scripting language designed to be as easy as possible to embed into another program. It arises from the need of having a modern scripting language with built-in support for OOP whilst mantaning simplicity of use and a low memory footprint. It can be viewed as a middle ground between Python, a more complete scripting language with lots of features and libraries, and Lua, a small and compact language that is simple to embed but doesn't provide OOP functionalities out of the box. J* tries to take the best of both worlds, implementing a fully featured class system while maintaining a small standard library and employing the use of a stack based API for communication among the language and host program, rendering embedding simple.

- [JMatch](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Projects/jmatch/) - The JMatch language extends Java with pattern matching that supports both data abstraction and iteration abstraction. Patterns are not tied to algebraic data constructors as in ML; instead, a single JMatch method may be used in several modes, some of which can serve as patterns. JMatch provides modal abstraction that simplifies the specification and implementation of abstract data types. These modes that may share a common implementation as a boolean formula. Thus, the specification, implementation, and use of iteration abstractions are made convenient, by automatically finding multiple solutions to a formula or pattern.
- [JME](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jme/) - Java Math Expression - a powerful mathematical evaluator in Spanish and a structured script language, JMEScript, that makes use of it.

- [Jolt](https://web.archive.org/web/20050204015205/http://jolt-lang.org/) - Jolt is a systems programming language intended to be used anywhere one would use C++. It is as willing to get dirty in the name of performance. It is not willing to compromise in the name of compatibility with legacy languages. It is a language in which everything is an object, inheriting from Object, including the “primitive” types, and yet is capable of implementing many of these same types in itself. It includes features traditionally seen in dynamically-typed object-oriented languages such as Ruby, and even has some LISP features, yet does so in a way that preserves strong static typing and the performance benefits thereof.
- [Joy](https://hypercubed.github.io/joy/joy.html) - The language Joy is a purely functional programming language. Whereas all other functional programming languages are based on the application of functions to arguments, Joy is based on the composition of functions. All such functions take a stack as argument and produce a stack as value. Consequently much of Joy looks like ordinary postfix notation. However, in Joy a function can consume any number of parameters from the stack and leave any number of results on the stack. The concatenation of appropriate programs denotes the composition of the functions which the programs denote. One of the datatypes of Joy is that of quoted programs, of which lists are a special case. Some functions expect quoted programs on top of the stack and execute them in many different ways, effectively by dequoting.

The idea is that nearly all programming languages are based in the idea of flow of control. What do we get when we try to orient around flow of data instead? One immediate reaction would be, well, I bet it is like programming with pipes and filters in UNIX", and sure enough it is, but Lucid goes a little beyond that.

- [Lush](https://lush.sourceforge.net/) - Lush is an object-oriented programming language designed for researchers, experimenters, and engineers interested in large-scale numerical and graphic applications. Lush is designed to be used in situations where one would want to combine the flexibility of a high-level, weakly-typed interpreted language, with the efficiency of a strongly-typed, natively-compiled language, and with the easy integration of code written in C, C++, or other languages. Lush is Free Software (under the GPL license) and runs on GNU/Linux, Solaris, Irix, and Windows under Cygwin. Lush can be used advantageously for projects where one would otherwise use a combination of an interpreted language like Matlab, Python, Perl, S+, or even (gasp!) BASIC, and a compiled language like C. Lush brings the best of both worlds by wrapping three languages into one: (1) a weakly-typed, garbage-collected, dynamically scoped, interpreted language with a simple Lisp-like syntax, (2) a strongly-typed, lexically-scoped compiled language that uses the same Lisp-like syntax, and (3) the C language, which can be freely mixed with Lush code within a single program, even within a single function. It sounds complicated, but it is not. In fact, Lush is designed to be very simple to learn and easy to use.

The power of modularization of mixins is enhanced by two unique features. The first feature is the modularization of constructors. In Magda, many mixins with independent definitions of constructors can be combined without the need to copy any code and without the risk of clashes. The second distinctive feature modifies the way declarations of new methods, overriding methods, and method calls are done, in order to rule out accidental name clashes, even with respect to future modifications 
of the code. 
- [Magmide](https://github.com/magmide/magmide) - A dependently-typed language intended to make provably correct code possible for working software engineers.
- [Magnet](https://github.com/marcelklehr/magnet) - Magnet is an object-oriented programming language, that is prototype-based to the point of real types being absent in favor of duck types. E.g. every object providing a read method that returns a readable, is considered "readable" (meaning it can represent a string). Since this causes a recursion, there must be some "primal" readable to end that: Such primal readable is also known as a String Object in Magnet. Furthermore, Magnet is syntax driven. This means: Everything that can be done to reduce code, retain simplicity and to amaze the developer, IS done!

- [MarkovJunior](https://github.com/mxgmn/MarkovJunior) - MarkovJunior is a probabilistic programming language where programs are combinations of rewrite rules and inference is performed via constraint propagation. MarkovJunior is named after mathematician Andrey Andreyevich Markov, who defined and studied what is now called Markov algorithms.
- [Mars](https://launchpad.net/mars) - Mars is a very simple imperative programming language with a catch: all of the functions and expressions are pure. That means when you call a function, it is guaranteed to have no side-effects: it can't mutate its arguments, modify global variables, or perform input/output. But unlike other pure languages, Mars gives you all the nice features of imperative programming, like local variable assignments and loops. The compiler also automatically converts inefficient copy-and-update operations into in-place destructive operations. Mars also has some other nice features borrowed from functional programming: a strong static type system, algebraic data types, pattern-matching switch statements, and higher-order functions. Mars is an experiment, not a full-featured programming language. You can use it for playing with the boundaries between imperative and declarative programming, but we don't recommend you write real software with it.

- [Merlin](http://frenetic-lang.org/merlin/) - Merlin is a new network management framework that allows administrators to express policies in a high-level, declarative language based on regular expressions. The compiler automatically partitions those policies into components that can be placed on a variety of devices including switches, middleboxes, and end hosts. The compiler uses a constraint-solver to determine the optimal placement strategy using paramaterizable heuristics. Sub-policies may be further constrained by network tenants, facilitating management of federated networks. Merlin provides techniques for verifying that both the partitioned program components and the delegated sub-policies conform to the global network policy. Overall, Merlin simplifies the task of network administration by providing high-level abstractions for specifying network policies and scalable infrastructure for enforcing them.

- [MLF](https://www.pearltrees.com/s/file/preview/274497891/icfp.pdf?pearlId=459776433) - We propose a type system MLF that generalizes ML with first-class polymorphism as in System F. Expressions may contain second- order type annotations. Every typable expression admits a principal type, which however depends on type annotations. Principal types capture all other types that can be obtained by implicit type instan- tiation and they can be inferred. All expressions of ML are well- typed without any annotations. All expressions of System F can be mechanically encoded into MLF by dropping all type abstractions and type applications, and injecting types of lambda-abstractions into MLF types. Moreover, only parameters of lambda-abstractions that are used polymorphically need to remain annotated.

NScript automatically compiles the code into an assembly in memory and executes the assembly. The NScript setup application associates NScript with ".ncs" (for C# scripts), ".nvb" (for VB.NET scripts) and ".njs" (for JScript .NET scripts) file extensions. This enables any code written in these files to be executed directly by double clicking on these files in windows explorer. I wrote this tool when I needed to write a script for automating builds. A simple batch file was not sufficient for the task and I preferred to write code in C# as opposed to VBScript or JScript. This tool came in handy as I could modify the scripts easily and execute them by double clicking on the files in windows explorer.

- [Piccola](https://scg.unibe.ch/research/piccola) - Piccola is a small, pure language for building applications from software components. Piccola is small in the sense that its syntax is tiny, and it is pure in the sense that it provides only compositional features — computation is performed entirely by components of the host programming language. The semantics of Piccola is defined in terms of a process calculus, an extension of Milner's pi calculus in which values communicated are forms, rather than tuples. A "form" is essentially an extensible nested record which also serves as a namespace in which expressions may be evaluated. This simple mechanism is responsible for much of the expressive power of Piccola.
- [Pico](http://pico.vub.ac.be/welcome.html) - Pico is a tiny but expressive programming language that was especially designed to teach advance computer science concepts to students in other sciences than computer science (such as Physics and Chemistry). In a sense, Pico can be seen as a non-trivial marriage between the power of languages like Scheme, and, the standard infix notation students are used to from ordinary calculus. A.o., Pico features garbage collected tables (i.e. arrays), higher order functions, objects, meta programming and reflection. But above all, Pico is small! Really small!
- [PicoLisp](https://github.com/picolisp/pil21) - PicoLisp is a programming language, a dialect of the language Lisp. Its most prominent features are simplicity and minimalism.

- [Pict](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/pict/Html/Pict.html) - Pict, a concurrent programming language based on the pi-calculus. Pict is a language in the ML tradition, formed by adding a layer of convenient syntactic sugar and a static type system to a tiny core. The current release includes a Pict-to-C compiler, reference manual, language tutorial, numerous libraries, and example programs. The core language - an asynchronous variant of Milner, Parrow, and Walker's pi-calculus - has been used as a theoretical foundation for a broad class of concurrent computations. The goal in Pict is to identify high-level idioms that arise naturally when these primitives are used to build working programs - idioms such as basic data structures, protocols for returning results, higher-order programming, selective communication, and concurrent objects. The type system integrates a number of features found in recent work on theoretical foundations for typed object-oriented languages: higher-order polymorphism, simple recursive types, subtyping, and a powerful partial type inference algorithm.

- [STOICAL](https://stoical.sourceforge.net/summary.php) - STOICAL is vastly different from its predecessors. Primarily because so much has changed since the decades ago that they were developed.  Today STOICAL is powerful and general enough to be used as a high performance replacement for semi-compiled and interpreted languages like Perl, Python, SED and Awk. And because of STOICAL's advanced support for networking and concurrent threads of execution, it can be used to write efficient long-running servers and daemons that would normally need to be written in C. The intent here is not to explore the intricacies of archaic systems, but to create a new and modern language, well suited to the world as it exists today. STOICAL might therefore be more accurately represented by the recursive acronym SINS, SINS Is Not STOIC, but this word has a remarkable stigma attached to it ;-)

The object being rewritten by a Tandem program is a collection of labelled stacks -- a finite mapping from strings to strings. The strings are always rewritten at the left edge, so they are effectively stacks. A Tandem program consists of a single rewrite rule along with zero or more pragmas. The rewrite rule is applied to an initial state to possibly obtain a final state. This rule is applied only once. However, in Tandem, a rule is a composite object which may contain subrules that get applied many times.
