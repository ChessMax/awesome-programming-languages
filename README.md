- [Ivy](https://github.com/jhallen/ivy-lang) - Ivy is an extensible, dynamically typed, late binding language intended to be used as an embedded command language. It can also be used stand-alone: it can execute script files from the command line or presents a read-eval-print loop (REPL) to the user if no files are given. Ivy's extensibility is based on the fact that statements are syntactically identical to function calls. Also blocks (surrounded by braces) may be used as function arguments. Thus, new user-defined statements can be added just by defining functions. Function arguments are packaged up as thunks and may have their evaluation delayed and execution environment modified. This allows user defined functions to do many of the things that traditional language statements can do.

Floating point or arbitrary length floating point numbers will be available in a future implementation. Ivy comes packaged as an interactive language like BASIC and LISP. You can either execute language statements immediately from the keyboard or run a program stored in a file. Ivy is also easy to embed into another program. Calls are provided to execute Ivy code and to add C function extensions to Ivy's interpreter.

Patterns are not tied to algebraic data constructors as in ML; instead, a single JMatch method may be used in several modes, some of which can serve as patterns. JMatch provides modal abstraction that simplifies the specification and implementation of abstract data types. These modes that may share a common implementation as a boolean formula. Thus, the specification, implementation, and use of iteration abstractions are made convenient, by automatically finding multiple solutions to a formula or pattern.

It is a language in which everything is an object, inheriting from Object, including the ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù types, and yet is capable of implementing many of these same types in itself. It includes features traditionally seen in dynamically-typed object-oriented languages such as Ruby, and even has some LISP features, yet does so in a way that preserves strong static typing and the performance benefits thereof.
- [Joy](https://hypercubed.github.io/joy/joy.html) - The language Joy is a purely functional programming language. Whereas all other functional programming languages are based on the application of functions to arguments, Joy is based on the composition of functions. All such functions take a stack as argument and produce a stack as value. Consequently much of Joy looks like ordinary postfix notation. However, in Joy a function can consume any number of parameters from the stack and leave any number of results on the stack. The concatenation of appropriate programs denotes the composition of the functions which the programs denote. One of the datatypes of Joy is that of quoted programs, of which lists are a special case. Some functions expect quoted programs on top of the stack and execute them in many different ways, effectively by dequoting.

- [Lush](https://lush.sourceforge.net/) - Lush is an object-oriented programming language designed for researchers, experimenters, and engineers interested in large-scale numerical and graphic applications. Lush is designed to be used in situations where one would want to combine the flexibility of a high-level, weakly-typed interpreted language, with the efficiency of a strongly-typed, natively-compiled language, and with the easy integration of code written in C, C++, or other languages. Lush is Free Software (under the GPL license) and runs on GNU/Linux, Solaris, Irix, and Windows under Cygwin. Lush can be used advantageously for projects where one would otherwise use a combination of an interpreted language like Matlab, Python, Perl, S+, or even (gasp!) BASIC, and a compiled language like C. Lush brings the best of both worlds by wrapping three languages into one: (1) a weakly-typed, garbage-collected, dynamically scoped, interpreted language with a simple Lisp-like syntax, (2) a strongly-typed, lexically-scoped compiled language that uses the same Lisp-like syntax, and (3) the C language, which can be freely mixed with Lush code within a single program, even within a single function. It sounds complicated, but it is not. In fact, Lush is designed to be very simple to learn and easy to use.

Since this causes a recursion, there must be some "primal" readable to end that: Such primal readable is also known as a String Object in Magnet. Furthermore, Magnet is syntax driven. This means: Everything that can be done to reduce code, retain simplicity and to amaze the developer, IS done!

MarkovJunior is named after mathematician Andrey Andreyevich Markov, who defined and studied what is now called Markov algorithms.
- [Mars](https://launchpad.net/mars) - Mars is a very simple imperative programming language with a catch: all of the functions and expressions are pure. That means when you call a function, it is guaranteed to have no side-effects: it can't mutate its arguments, modify global variables, or perform input/output. But unlike other pure languages, Mars gives you all the nice features of imperative programming, like local variable assignments and loops. The compiler also automatically converts inefficient copy-and-update operations into in-place destructive operations. Mars also has some other nice features borrowed from functional programming: a strong static type system, algebraic data types, pattern-matching switch statements, and higher-order functions. Mars is an experiment, not a full-featured programming language. You can use it for playing with the boundaries between imperative and declarative programming, but we don't recommend you write real software with it.

- [Merlin](http://frenetic-lang.org/merlin/) - Merlin is a new network management framework that allows administrators to express policies in a high-level, declarative language based on regular expressions. The compiler automatically partitions those policies into components that can be placed on a variety of devices including switches, middleboxes, and end hosts. The compiler uses a constraint-solver to determine the optimal placement strategy using paramaterizable heuristics. Sub-policies may be further constrained by network tenants, facilitating management of federated networks. Merlin provides techniques for verifying that both the partitioned program components and the delegated sub-policies conform to the global network policy. Overall, Merlin simplifies the task of network administration by providing high-level abstractions for specifying network policies and scalable infrastructure for enforcing them.

For example, one could create a GUI front-end for drawing graphs using the data generated by a script written in the Misc language. The functionality of the Misc Engine by itself is limited to calculations, data manipulations and simple I/O operations. However its ability to be extended with additional functions makes it a powerful tool.

- [MLF](https://www.pearltrees.com/s/file/preview/274497891/icfp.pdf?pearlId=459776433) - We propose a type system MLF that generalizes ML with first-class polymorphism as in System F. Expressions may contain second- order type annotations. Every typable expression admits a principal type, which however depends on type annotations. Principal types capture all other types that can be obtained by implicit type instan- tiation and they can be inferred. All expressions of ML are well- typed without any annotations. All expressions of System F can be mechanically encoded into MLF by dropping all type abstractions and type applications, and injecting types of lambda-abstractions into MLF types. Moreover, only parameters of lambda-abstractions that are used polymorphically need to remain annotated.

- [ŒºC++](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~usystem/uC++.html) -  The ŒºC++ project extends C++ with new constructs providing advanced control-flow including light-weight concurrency on shared-memory uni- and multi-processor computers running UNIX and Linux operating systems. ŒºC++ accomplishes this by providing new kinds of classes: coroutines, which have independent execution states; tasks, which have their own threads; and monitors, which allow for safe communication among tasks. These new classes can take part in inheritance, overloading, and templates, just like other classes. As well, C++ exception handling is extended, allowing exceptions to propagate among coroutines and tasks. Additional capabilities include: clustering of tasks and processors, object-oriented non-blocking I/O for files and sockets, and support for real-time programming. True parallelism is achieved utilizing operating-system kernel-threads. ŒºC++ clarifies and extends object-oriented concurrency providing generality and functionality that surpasses languages like Ada, Java, and C#.

NScript automatically compiles the code into an assembly in memory and executes the assembly. The NScript setup application associates NScript with ".ncs" (for C# scripts), ".nvb" (for VB.NET scripts) and ".njs" (for JScript .NET scripts) file extensions. This enables any code written in these files to be executed directly by double clicking on these files in windows explorer. I wrote this tool when I needed to write a script for automating builds. A simple batch file was not sufficient for the task and I preferred to write code in C# as opposed to VBScript or JScript. This tool came in handy as I could modify the scripts easily and execute them by double clicking on the files in windows explorer.

A "form" is essentially an extensible nested record which also serves as a namespace in which expressions may be evaluated. This simple mechanism is responsible for much of the expressive power of Piccola.
- [Pico](http://pico.vub.ac.be/welcome.html) - Pico is a tiny but expressive programming language that was especially designed to teach advance computer science concepts to students in other sciences than computer science (such as Physics and Chemistry). In a sense, Pico can be seen as a non-trivial marriage between the power of languages like Scheme, and, the standard infix notation students are used to from ordinary calculus. A.o., Pico features garbage collected tables (i.e. arrays), higher order functions, objects, meta programming and reflection. But above all, Pico is small! Really small!
- [PicoLisp](https://github.com/picolisp/pil21) - PicoLisp is a programming language, a dialect of the language Lisp. Its most prominent features are simplicity and minimalism. It is built on one internal data type: a cell. On the language level, a programmer can use three different data types (numbers, symbols, and lists) being represented by cells and differentiated by bits at the end of the cell.
- [Pict](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/pict/Html/Pict.html) - Pict, a concurrent programming language based on the pi-calculus. Pict is a language in the ML tradition, formed by adding a layer of convenient syntactic sugar and a static type system to a tiny core. The current release includes a Pict-to-C compiler, reference manual, language tutorial, numerous libraries, and example programs. The core language - an asynchronous variant of Milner, Parrow, and Walker's pi-calculus - has been used as a theoretical foundation for a broad class of concurrent computations. The goal in Pict is to identify high-level idioms that arise naturally when these primitives are used to build working programs - idioms such as basic data structures, protocols for returning results, higher-order programming, selective communication, and concurrent objects. The type system integrates a number of features found in recent work on theoretical foundations for typed object-oriented languages: higher-order polymorphism, simple recursive types, subtyping, and a powerful partial type inference algorithm.

Zephir extensions are exported to C code that can be compiled and optimized by major C compilers such as gcc/clang/vc++. Functionality is exposed to the PHP language.
- [zeptoforth](https://github.com/tabemann/zeptoforth) - zeptoforth is a Cortex-M Forth, currently targeted at RP2040 boards such as the Raspberry Pi Pico, the Raspberry Pi Pico W, the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect, the Cytron Maker Nano RP2040, the SeeedStudio XIAO RP2040, and the WIO RP2040 (which it has been tested with) using 25Q Quad SPI flash compatible with the Winbond Quad SPI flash on the Raspberry Pi Pico, RP2350 boards such as the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 and the Pimoroni Pico Plus 2, the STM32L476, STM32F407, and STM32F746 DISCOVERY boards, and the STM32F411 "Black Pill" board. Ports to more platforms are on hold due to the current chip shortage (aside from a possible port to an STM32H7 board I have lying around somewhere). A hack exists for getting zeptoforth to work properly on STM32F411 Nucleo 64 boards using the binaries compiled for STM32F411 "Black Pill" boards.
