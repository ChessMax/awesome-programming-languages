It has inductive families, i.e., data types which depend on values, such as the type of vectors of a given length. It also has parametrised modules, mixfix operators, Unicode characters, and an interactive Emacs interface which can assist the programmer in writing the program.
- [Aith](https://github.com/Superstar64/aith) - Low level functional programming language with linear types, Generalized Inline Functions, levity polymorphism and regions. Aith is a perfomant systems programming language with am empathises on type systems. As of now Aith is very early stages and very little is implemented.
- [Ante](https://github.com/jfecher/ante) - Ante is a low-level functional language for exploring refinement types, lifetime inference, and other fun features. In general, ante is low-level (no GC, values aren't boxed by default) while also trying to be as readable as possible by encouraging high-level approaches that can be optimized with low-level details later on.
- [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)) - APL (named after the book A Programming Language) is a programming language developed in the 1960s by Kenneth E. Iverson. Its central datatype is the multidimensional array. It uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators, leading to very concise code. It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling, spreadsheets, functional programming, and computer math packages. It has also inspired several other programming languages.
- [Arend](https://github.com/JetBrains/Arend) - Arend is a theorem prover and a programming language based on Homotopy Type Theory.
